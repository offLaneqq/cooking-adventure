    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>This is my first website project written in php using JavaScript, SCSS and WordPress.
        I decided to try to write something related to recipes, because I
        thought it would be relevant to both the older generation and the younger generation,
        because everyone is equal in front of cooking.
